Welcome to python-graphenelib's documentation!
===============================================

Graphene is a blockchain technology (i.e. software) that allows for fast
transactions and decentralized trading of assets as well as customized on-chain
smart contracts.

In practice, Graphene is only a concept implementation and does not directly
have its own public blockchain.

The first public blockchain to use the Graphene technology is *BitShares 2.0*.
However, this library should be able to interface with any other Graphene-based
blockchain, too.
